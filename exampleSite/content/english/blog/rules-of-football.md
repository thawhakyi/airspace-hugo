Football is a game that many play but few understand it. In any game, half of the bar or stadium will burst into applause at the behest of other fans without really knowing what has just happened. It will help those of you who have not yet learned the game and act as a refresher course for those in the know.

**The goal of football is to get as many points as possible. The team that scores the most points in a given period is the winner. This is the easy part.**

The rules of football can be confusing. Before it is not called "football" it is called "gridiron" since that was the name of the playing field. The gridiron has markings that resemble a grill and are 120 meters long and 53 meters long. -1 / 3 meters wide. The 120 meters are divided into five sections, each 20 meters in length. Playing field lines are marked every five meters and numbered from each goal line in the center of the field, also known as the fifty yard mark. Still confused? Listen to this: A grid is made up of side and back lines and has field posts near each end area. The end zones are 10 meters wide and are located just before the field post. Field positions are used to score field goals. They are 18.5 feet apart.

It's just a description of the field. We haven't even started with the rules of football. A soccer game is played between two teams. NFL teams typically have fifty or more members, but only eleven can be on the field at a time. Because the game is so complicated, most of the fifty players have the opportunity to play any game. Every team member has a special role, whether offensive or defensive. The players wear uniformly numbered uniforms. Every soccer team also has special teams.

It is difficult to tell the length of a football game as coaches and players may receive penalties and fouls that add to the length of a game. Big games like the Super Bowl can take hours. Every call has to be made as much is at stake in a game of this caliber.

According to the rules of football, each team must try to advance on the field and gain as many meters as possible at the same time. The closer the advancing team is to the goal line, the harder the opposing team has to play to stop a touchdown. If defensive players attack and knock down the advancing runner, it is game over and the ball is dead.

The goal of football is to score touchdowns and goals on the field because that earns you points. The team with the most points gets all the glory. If it is a championship game, the winning team also wins the title.

Get points and win the game. If those are the basic football rules, maybe it isn't so confusing after all.
